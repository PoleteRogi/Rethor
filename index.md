# Rethor
A free retro game engine. Made in JavaScript and Electron.

Rethor is open source and it makes it easy to code games. Just code your dream game in Lua, and Rethor will do for you.

## Limitations
Rethor is still in development, so its very limited by the time. But if you want, you can support us! At the itch.io page, you can donate.
